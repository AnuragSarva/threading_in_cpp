## Structure and Content

### 1. **Introduction to Threads in C++**
   - **Markdown**: Explains the concept of threads, their purpose, and how they differ from processes.
   - **Code**: Demonstrates thread creation using function pointers in C++11.

### 2. **Ways to Create Threads**
   - **Markdown**: Lists five ways to create threads in C++11:
     1. Function Pointer
     2. Lambda Function
     3. Functors
     4. Member Functions
     5. Static Member Functions
   - **Code**: Provides examples for each method.

### 3. **Thread Management**
   - **Markdown**: Discusses `join()`, `detach()`, and `joinable()` methods.
   - **Code**: Examples show how to use these methods to manage thread lifecycles.

### 4. **Mutex and Race Conditions**
   - **Markdown**: Introduces the concept of race conditions and critical sections.
   - **Code**: Demonstrates the use of `std::mutex` to prevent race conditions.

### 5. **Advanced Mutex Features**
   - **Markdown**: Explains `try_lock()`, `timed_mutex`, and `recursive_mutex`.
   - **Code**: Examples illustrate how to use these features for advanced synchronization.

### 6. **Thread Synchronization**
   - **Markdown**: Covers synchronization techniques like condition variables and semaphores.
   - **Code**: Examples include producer-consumer problems and signaling between threads.

### 7. **Thread Safety**
   - **Markdown**: Discusses thread safety issues with static variables and how to resolve them.
   - **Code**: Demonstrates the use of `std::atomic` for thread-safe operations.

### 8. **Thread Pools**
   - **Markdown**: Explains the concept of thread pools and their advantages.
   - **Code**: Implements a basic thread pool to manage multiple tasks efficiently.

### 9. **Object Pools**
   - **Markdown**: Introduces object pools for reusing resources like database connections or threads.
   - **Code**: Implements an object pool with multithreading support.

### 10. **Scoped Lock**
   - **Markdown**: Explains the `std::scoped_lock` feature for managing multiple mutexes.
   - **Code**: Demonstrates its usage in a multithreaded environment.

### 11. **Atomic Variables**
   - **Markdown**: Discusses the use of atomic variables to avoid race conditions without locks.
   - **Code**: Provides examples of atomic operations.

### 12. **Deadlocks and Avoidance**
   - **Markdown**: Explains deadlocks and strategies to avoid them.
   - **Code**: Demonstrates scenarios leading to deadlocks and their resolution.

### 13. **Producer-Consumer Problem**
   - **Markdown**: Explains the classic producer-consumer problem and its solution using condition variables.
   - **Code**: Implements the solution with detailed comments.

### 14. **Thread Pool Implementation**
   - **Markdown**: Discusses the benefits of thread pools and their implementation.
   - **Code**: Provides a complete implementation of a thread pool.

### 15. **OverSubscription**
   - **Markdown**: Explains the concept of oversubscription in multithreading and its impact on performance.

### 16. **Binary Semaphore**
   - **Markdown**: Introduces binary semaphores for signaling between threads.
   - **Code**: Demonstrates producer-consumer synchronization using semaphores.

### 17. **Comparison: Mutex vs Semaphore**
   - **Markdown**: Highlights the differences between mutexes and semaphores, including their use cases and mechanisms.
